## Exp-1 - GAP

Pizza is almost ready, looks really good, lets add seasoning to enhance the taste

> GAP - 
Adding the GAP to squeeze that last bit of accuracy by calculating the receptive field, and a 1*1 convolution after that (Not an FC!!!)

Reduced params might lead to reduced accuracy, we will get to see how effective is GAP

## Results

- No of parameters - 7076
- No of epochs - 15
- Dropout - *5%
- Starting training accuracy - 87.14
- Starting testing accuracy - 98.24
- Max training accuracy - 98.94%
- Max testing accuracy - 99.49%

### Analysis


- Underdog shines!!!! GAP works everyone!!! We did it!!! 

Logs are beautiful, graphs are beautiful, my life is beautiful. TSAI is beautiful

## Future Aspirations

- Mera ho gaya!!! :P

*********************************************

## Exp-2 - Dropout

I know, I am getting greedy, just wanted to do some experiments with Dropout, we are already too hard on the model, lets give the guy some slack.

> Dropout 3%

## Results

- No of parameters - 7076
- No of epochs - 15
- Dropout - *3%
- Starting training accuracy - 87.51
- Starting testing accuracy - 98.24
- Max training accuracy - 99.04%
- Max testing accuracy - 99.52%

### Analysis

We have outsmarted ourselves!!, results speaks

## Future Aspirations

- Abhi pakka ho gaya!!! :P :P
