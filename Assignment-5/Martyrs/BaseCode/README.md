# Base Code

## Target  

> This code contains the base code that sets the ground for further experimentations.

## Results  

- No of parameters - 63,79,786
- Max training accuracy of epochs - 100%
- Max testing accuracy of epochs - 99.37
- No of epochs used - 20


## Analysis

- The model is using too many parameters  Total - 63,79,786 (Almost 6 million!!!)

- There is a significant gap in training accuracy and test accuracy (Almost .6 - .7 %)

- Since training accuracy has reached almost 100% there is no further scope of increasing the test accuracy

- As the dataset is small and model is kinda huge, we can conclude that this might be the case of Shaving with a chain saw

- The model is not capable of pushing any further

- Test accuracy sees large values of ups and downs.

- Average loss shows has increased with the no of epochs

- The test accuracy and loss are not stable, we can see there is a big bump while processing
