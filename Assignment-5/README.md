## Target  

- 99.4% (this must be consistently shown in your last few epochs, and not a one-time achievement)
- Less than or equal to 15 Epochs
- Less than 10000 Parameters (additional points for doing this in less than 8000 pts)
- Do this in exactly 4 steps
- Each File must have "target, result, analysis" TEXT block (either at the start or the end)
- You must convince why have you decided that your target should be what you have decided it to be, and your analysis MUST be correct
- Evaluation is highly subjective, and if you target anything out of the order, marks will be deducted. 
- Explain your 4 steps using these target, results, and analysis with links to your GitHub files (Colab files moved to GitHub)
- Keep Receptive field calculations handy for each of your models.
- If your GitHub folder structure or file_names are messy, -100.

## Our Submission

 The target is acheived in 4 Steps, each steps has involved sevral experiments. 
 
  Each step has its own README file, I have tried to explain all these results of experiments with my analysis, experimentation and results in the individual README file in an intutive way.

Codes that didn't make it to final step can be found in Martyrs directory. (RIP!!!)

## Final Results

- No of parameters - 7076
- No of epochs - 15
- Dropout - *3%
- Starting training accuracy - 87.51
- Starting testing accuracy - 98.24
- Max training accuracy - 99.04%
- Max testing accuracy - 99.52%
