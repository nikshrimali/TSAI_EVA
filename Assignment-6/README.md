## Target  

GBN Note: read the paper. Please make sure you are not using the same batch size for BN and GBN jobs below. 

- Your assignment 6 is to take your best 5th code, and run bellow versions for 25 epochs and report findings:
  - with L1 + BN
  - with L2 + BN
  - with L1 and L2 with BN
  - with GBN
  - with L1 and L2 with GBN

- You cannot be running your code 5 times manually (-500 points for that). You need to be smarter and write a single loop or iterator to iterate through these conditions.
- draw ONE graph to show the validation accuracy curves for all 5 jobs above. This graph must have proper legends and it should be clear what we are looking at.
- draw ONE graph to show the loss change curves for all 5 jobs above. This graph must have proper legends and it should be clear what we are looking at.
- find any 25 misclassified images (combined into single image) for "with GBN" model. You should be using the saved model from the above jobs.  You MUST show the actual and predicted class names.
the explanatory README file that explains what is your code all about, your findings, and your single image showing 25 misclassified images.
- submit the Github link
 
Here are some of the questions for S6-Assignment-Solution:

- Upload the Validation Accuracy Change Graph (all 5 models combined) - 100 pts
- Upload the Loss Change Graph (all 5 models combined) - 100 pts
- Upload the image showing 25 misclassified images for the "with GBN" model. - 250 pts
- Explain your observation w.r.t. L1 and L2's performance in the regularization of your model. - 50 pts
